# Python

#### All of my Python projects

> so far, the only projects that are not tutorials in this repo are:
* RentalHouse.py, which I created as a quick reference to calculate basic analysis on a house for sale to determine whether it may be profitable as a rental.
* I also created an app that isn't posted to github. The Console prompts the user to input a number between 1-10, and then returns the associated value from a list. I created this app to help decide what local attraction to visit within a defined radius.
